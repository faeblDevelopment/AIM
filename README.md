Analysis of the Interplanetary Magnetic field data; Open Sense- Android App, Java

##History
This is an Android App. designed for analyising the interplanetary magneticfield fluctuations between sun and earth, obtained from the GEOS-Satellite.
The main purpose of the  app was to categorize the fluctuations in real-time and to generate tone signals that map to the signal-strengths. 
In this context, the signal strengths (integer data from 0 to 4) are converted to the corresponding tones and then sent to the audio Output.

What's the point of this software?
Along with the project, a wristband is built, that converts the integer signals coming from the bluetooth module to magnetic flucuations. (Therefore the wristband has an integrated coil, that produces magnetic "signals" [like in headphones].)
Me, the head of the project, has got a magnetic implant in the ringfinger. That way I can feel the strength of the current integervalue of the fluctuation.

This Project is an Open-Source approach to a programmable sense, for feeling any data that are sent to the wristband.
Have fun experimenting.
If you have any questions, want to collaborate etc. don't hesitate to contact me at faebl.taylor@protonmail.com or 
w.fabian.schneider@gmail.com.

Although the Project is licenced under the MIT-Licence, some credit would be nice if you develop it on your own.
If you work on the project please send a pull request so everybody can make use of the improvements.
Soon I will also add the schedules for the wristband and some links for magnetic implants.

Fantastic times ahead of us...


Have fun discovering fascination,
Fabian Schneider
